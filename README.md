Jared aims to make all those pesky dependency updates on Android easy. Just relax and let us take the wheel.

## How?

By the power of magic, Jared just *knows* when one of your dependencies has an update released. Then, he'll update that dependency on your git repo and make a PR directly to Github! You can then check what's been changed, and if you integrate with any CI of your choice, the tests will be run.

Then it's completely up to you. You can fix any issues that might have arised on that specific branch, or merge directly if no issues have appeared. Jared will never risk merging any kind of code, so you can sleep soundly at night.

## Why?

Developers must focus on what's important. There is simply no time to keep up with dependencies, especially on a fast-paced and highly coupled environment. That's why we developed Jared, we use it ourselves and he's become much like a team member.
